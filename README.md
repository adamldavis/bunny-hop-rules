Bunny Hop Rules
===============

#Basic Play

_Objective: Get the treasure!_

To begin the adult should place walls, doors, rocks, and treasure pieces on the game board. Start with a simple design and build up the complexity over several games. Place the arrows and keys in separate stacks split evenly among the players. Each player chooses a bunny and places it at one of the start squares.

Then the child players take turns (starting with the youngest). Here is a typical turn:

- Child places an arrow in front of them facing the direction they want the bunny to move.
- Adult moves the bunny and takes the arrow (feel free to make the bunny hop).
- If the move is impossible tell the child and let them try again.

To open a door, a key must be played. 
Then the adult either flips the door over or just removes it.

Treasure is acquired when a bunny gets to it.

Whoever gets the most treasure wins the game (but the main goal is to have fun!).

##Rocks

Rocks move with the following rules:

- Rocks can be pushed by a bunny.
- Rocks can't go through walls, closed doors, treasure, bunnies, or other rocks.

With these rules, and a little creativity, you can make quite complex games.

##Functions/Loops

With older children you can introduce the following additional rules over time:

- Cards can be played up to three at a time.
- Cards can be put into “functions” (a line of any number of cards that can be executed).
- Players can make “loops” (a line of any number of cards that is repeated “forever”).

You can cut out lengths of yarn (or something similar) that represent “calling a function” or “looping”.
